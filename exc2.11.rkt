; Exercise 2.11
;
; In passing, Ben also cryptically comments: “By testing the signs of the
; endpoints of the intervals, it is possible to break mul-interval into nine
; cases, only one of which requires more than two multiplications.” Rewrite
; this procedure using Ben’s suggestion.

(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))
(define (lower-bound interval) (car interval))
(define (upper-bound interval) (cdr interval))

(define (mul-interval x y)
  (let ((p1 (* (lower-bound x)
               (lower-bound y)))
        (p2 (* (lower-bound x)
               (upper-bound y)))
        (p3 (* (upper-bound x)
               (lower-bound y)))
        (p4 (* (upper-bound x)
               (upper-bound y))))
    (make-interval (min p1 p2 p3 p4)
                   (max p1 p2 p3 p4))))
