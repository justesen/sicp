# Exercises for SICP
I'm attempting to work my way through the exercises from *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*. It's something I've attempted before, but not completed. Let's see if I'm more successful this time around.

The book is typeset beautifully at https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/ and, hence, that's where I read it. The original is at https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html.

I'm using the Racket language because it seems to be the most actively used Scheme dialect. Using the package [SICP Collections](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html) ensures compatibility with the code in the book; That's why all the files start with `#lang sicp`.

## Structure
There's one directory for each chapter. For each chapter `X`, I gather procedures that are used for multiple exercises in `chX.rkt`.
