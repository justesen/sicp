;
; Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to be provided as a special form.
; “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she
; asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she
; defines a new version of if:

(define (new-if predicate
                then-clause
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))

; Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
; 5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
; 0

; Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

; What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots?
; Explain.

; The interpreter is using applicative order, hence, it will evaluate all
; three arguments to new-if, so sqrt-iter will call itself indefinitely.
; Just try with (sqrt 2).

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
