; Exercise 2.51
;
; Define the below operation for painters. Below takes two painters as
; arguments. The resulting painter, given a frame, draws with the first painter
; in the bottom of the frame and with the second painter in the top. Define
; below in two different waysâ€”first by writing a procedure that is analogous to
; the beside procedure given above, and again in terms of beside and suitable
; rotation operations (from Exercise 2.50).
